# The Redfish Codegen Project

This project aims to develop tools which are used to translate the Redfish
specification into Rust code. The primary crate provided by this repository
is `redfish-codegen`, which contains an unopinionated translation of the
Redfish Schema Bundle (DSP8010) and the Redfish Base Registries Specification
(DSP8011).

See the Rust docs for more information.
